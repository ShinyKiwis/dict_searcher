# Dictionary Searcher
## What is this ?
This is a small program that will help you to crawl information about an english word from Oxford Dictionary to assit your
learning journey or quickly look up a definition of a word.

## Usage
Simply input your word and wait for the result. You will be asked if you want to save that word for future learning into `words.yaml`.
